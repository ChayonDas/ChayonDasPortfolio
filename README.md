# Interactive Bisection Method with Neumorphic Interface

This project is an interactive application built using Python's Tkinter that visualizes the Bisection Method for finding roots of a function. It is designed with a Neumorphic interface style and includes error analysis with 2D and 3D visualizations.

## Project Overview

The application allows users to:
- Input a mathematical function to find its root using the Bisection Method.
- Specify the interval \([a, b]\) to locate the root.
- Visualize the iterative steps on a 2D plot and a 3D surface plot.
- Analyze error metrics such as absolute and relative errors for each iteration.

## Features

- **Neumorphic Interface**: Provides a modern, soft UI design.
- **2D Plot**: Displays the function curve and iterative vertical lines for each midpoint calculation.
- **3D Plot**: Shows the function's surface with markers indicating the iterative steps.
- **Detailed Error Analysis**: Shows absolute and relative errors at each step.
- **Interactive GUI**: Simple interface for input and visualization.
